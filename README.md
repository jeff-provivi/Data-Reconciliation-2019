# Data pipeline

This utility converts Provivi data that is incorrectly formatted into Provivi data that is correctly formatted for
ingest into the Provivi App and into Provivi's statistical analysis programs.

Currently sandboxing in the terminal. Ran with this command:
python3 main.py -i ../data/Jalisco/ -o ../temp

Notes:
Trial J2 had some oddly formatted files, and was removed during development. 
19-MX-J2-WA-Sf-WC_04JUL
19-MX-J2-WA-Sf-WC_13JUN
19-MX-J2-WA-Sf-WC_27JUN was moved, as it had a differing format, but it seems legit and should be added back after initial work.
And others.


Same with trial J1

Same with trial J21

Same with trial J3
